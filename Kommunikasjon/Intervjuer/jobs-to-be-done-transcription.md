# Jobs to be Done - Presentation Transcription

## Presenters
- **Bob Moesta** - Engineer and product developer
- **Chris Speck** - Web development and software background, co-founder of The Rewired Group

## Introduction

**Bob Moesta**: We're here to talk about jobs to be done and hopefully introduce you to a new way to talk to consumers about why they buy what they buy.

Mark and I started talking a couple months ago about us coming here and doing the talk. He said you can have one person present, I said we need two, we got two. I said we need about eight hours to spread this concept and really get it embedded into people's heads. So you get one hour. So what we're gonna do is blast through this presentation, give you the framework and kind of the basics of what's going on, and then we're going to do a live interview up here and we're going to talk to somebody about a car that they bought and we're going to get to the bottom of what motivated them to buy the car.

The best way to introduce the framework is just to demonstrate it. We can talk about it all day but when you see it in action it really kind of brings home why we ask the questions that we ask and why we try to get to causality.

## Background

### Bob Moesta
My background is I'm an engineer basically. I've developed a lot of different products and what I struggled with was how the marketing information I got didn't help me figure out the features and benefits I really need to work on. And so this method was developed from that challenge, if you will.

The key to me is that when you start to talk to consumers you find that the struggling moment - the moment where they say "I couldn't do that" - it's when they start to look for something new. So to me it's finding those struggling moments in their life to find out where they need a new product and are they willing to go the distance, because a lot of people talk to talk but don't walk the talk. So how do we actually find people who can make the trade-off to make the progress?

**The struggling moment is the seed of innovation.**

### Chris Speck
I grew up in the web space in the 90s, ran a custom software development shop and then went on to start The Rewired Group with Bob, mostly out of a desire to have that deeper understanding about how people shop and why people buy. This was mostly out of just repeated failure - launching things that we hoped were going to catch on in the market, being positive at the onset that we understood the consumer need and then not getting the traction that we would get.

Bob introduced me to jobs to be done and said there are deeper patterns that you can uncover and there's an actual method to do it.

What I always say is: **What's the consumer going to stop doing when they start using your product?** There are things in the market that are additive - we can add new behavior - but oftentimes we want them to stop using the credit cards in their wallet and start using our mobile payment solution. What is the transformation that they need to go through to get to that point? It's always what we want to answer.

### Experience
Between Chris and I and the firm, we've developed over 3,000 products - everything from macaroni and cheese all the way to the Patriot missile. Our expertise is really around developing products, but what you find is if you don't have the core job that somebody's trying to get done, you can develop anything and it doesn't work, it doesn't get sold, it doesn't create a business.

## Core Concept: The Drill vs. The Hole

**Theodore Levitt (Harvard Business School)**: People don't want to buy the drill, they don't want the newer fancier drill - they want the hole, they want the outcome.

If you're able to nail the outcome or the progress the person is trying to make in their life, you can essentially take the solution out of it and start to think about different ways that you could create the outcome. So if they're trying to hang a picture, do they really need a hole? Can we have some fancy 3M adhesive that they can stick on the wall? What are the - we call them technology independent solutions - that will help this person make progress in their life?

## Competition and Arenas

What you actually find out is that in the consumer's mind, what they're thinking of and what you think of as competition is completely different.

**Examples:**
- Cars don't compete with cars - cars compete with bikes, taxis, rental services
- A Snickers bar doesn't compete with a Milky Way - people don't think "oh yeah maybe I'll have a Milky Way"
- They think of a Snickers and things like a sandwich, a Coke, other things

**Key Question**: What are these competitive arenas from the consumer's perspective, not from the industry perspective?

## Context Over Content

> "Do you like steak or do you like pizza?"

Most people will say "I like both." But when you really start to think about steak and you think about the last steak situation - you were out, you were celebrating, you're with family or with friends, you had a good bottle of wine - what happened if I took the steak out and put pizza in it? How much do you like pizza then?

If I do it vice versa, you find the same thing. So what happens is we tend to leave out all the context.

**Context adds value.** In some cases, context has more value than your product. Being at the right place at the right time is where you want to make sure you figure this out.

- **Content** is what you make
- **Context** is what it means to them

If you don't have the meaning, it's very hard to make the trade-offs. As an engineer, as a developer, we can't provide everything to everybody - we need to make trade-offs. Our ultimate job is to make the right trade-offs to make a profitable product. But if I don't have the context, I can't make the trade-offs.

### Beyond Demographics

This conflicts with or adds on to what we usually think of as demographic/psychographic segmentation.

**Clay Christensen** spoke here a couple years ago about jobs to be done and said it very eloquently: "The fact that I'm a 65-year-old professor at the Harvard Business School is not why I bought the New York Times this morning. There's something going on in my life, some progress that I need to make - it's the situation that drives me to buy."

We can't say that old executives eat steak and college kids eat pizza just blindly. We need to understand that situational context to understand when they'll pick one and when they'll pick the other.

## The Essence of Jobs to Be Done

The essence of jobs is being able to:
1. Find the context that people are in
2. Find out what they're trying to do
3. Understand the hiring criteria and firing criteria of what they're currently using

**Important**: There are no new jobs - people just make progress from the old job.

If we can actually understand:
- The hiring
- The firing
- The progress they're trying to make
- What product or service they pick

Because at the end of the day, consumers make trade-offs all day. They'll say they want this and this and this, and all of a sudden it's like "yeah but at the end of the day this is a good deal."

**How do we actually understand their version of a good deal in reality versus looking forward?** Because they can't put themselves in that situation if we ask them about what they're going to do - we'll never get the information we need.

## The Jobs to be Done Interview

We have this thing called the job to be done interview, and it's about **looking back**. We only talk to people who have bought.

### Example: 37signals/Basecamp
We worked with Jason Fried at 37signals. We talked to seven people who had just purchased Basecamp:
- Why did they buy Basecamp of all the things?
- Why Basecamp?
- Why now?

Then we talked to seven people who left Basecamp - not people who left because they had no project, but people who left to go to something else.

If you focus on the switching aspects of this thing, we can find the hiring criteria to say when other people get in that situation, how do I actually design the product to fit in that situation? It's pulling out that center piece and saying now I can develop new things to fit in it.

**The goal**: Get to the essence of the hiring criteria - why did somebody hire that? This is the causality. This happened, this happened, this happened, boom - they bought this. Understanding the causal relationships helps us design better and better products and services.

## Framework 1: The Forces Diagram

This is the core of what we're talking about. We've tried to unpack and describe the forces that are acting on somebody as they switch to a new product.

**Note**: This doesn't work for repeat purchases. If you're buying Tide laundry detergent every month and you're going through the aisle throwing it in your cart, there's no energy in that system until something new enters your mind and gets you thinking "hey I could make some progress here, I could make my laundry brighter, I could do it faster." That's when we start down this path.

### The Four Forces

#### 1. Push of the Current Situation
All about me, the consumer. What's going on in my life that is making me think that I need to change and make some progress to do something different?

I can stay in that state infinitely if all I'm thinking of is "I need to do something different, I need to do something different." We call it running on a treadmill.

#### 2. Pull of the New Solution
Until something comes into my life that introduces a new possibility - a concept of a new way, a product, a solution, a web service - something pops in. That service or solution will create magnetism, we call it pull.

Now I have a force that's pushing me, I have my current situation, and I have a pull of that new product or new service and everything related to it.

#### 3. Anxiety of the New Solution
We call this "below the water line." When I start to realize that this service or product could help me make progress, I have anxiety about it. I start thinking about all the things that I might not be able to accomplish with it:
- Will it deliver on its promises?
- Will I be able to use it effectively?
- Do I personally have the skills to use that product?

There's anxiety, so there's something pulling against me.

#### 4. Habit of the Present
In order to do this new thing, sometimes I have to give up what I'm doing now.

### Example: Level Up Credit Card
The Level Up credit card example was fantastic - it's a perfect way to illustrate this. A lot of us have looked at our wallet and said "I have all these credit cards that I'm carrying around, I have to pay them all separately, I've got to juggle them all the time when I'm at the cash register."

- **Push**: Might not be a huge push, but I've had the thought in my mind - I could carry less credit cards
- **Pull**: Not just technology pull, but "I want to be the guy at the cash register with this cool new thing." There's a social aspect to it. So it might save me money, but there might be something that's going to do between me and my friends creating that magnetism
- **Anxiety**: Tons of anxiety. I know how to use my credit cards, the bill comes every month, I know how to pay them. This is going to be a whole new thing. What if my phone dies? Now I'm at the cash register, I have no idea how to...
- **Habit**: I got to call every one of my credit card companies and say that I'm cancelling to move to this thing. I don't know how to get rid of them. If I have unpaid balances, can I transfer? How do I do that?

All of this will happen. It happens in an instant if you're at the checkout line buying a pack of gum. It happens over a period of years buying a house or a car.

### The Math
This can be seen as a math equation. **When the top two (push + pull) are greater than the bottom two (anxiety + habit), we call it a tip - it's a switch.** And it changes over time.

**Important**: Most of the time people add more pull, more features - "oh we'll get people to be more excited about this product if we add this and this and this to it." But what they don't understand is the anxiety. Half the time what we do is we help companies just take crap out of their product so people will buy it because of the anxiety.

**Nobody will actually tell you they're afraid**, but they will if you talk about something in the past.

## Framework 2: The Timeline

It's really kind of strange, but to be honest I've been doing this for almost 20 years and almost every purchase happens in this cycle, in these phases.

### The Phases

#### 1. First Thought
"You know, I should..."

**Example from moving/housing work**: 80% of people have the first thought between Thanksgiving and New Year's (at least in the US).

#### 2. Passive Looking
"Yeah I know I thought about it, I'm not investing, but if something comes by me I look at it."

#### 3. Event 1
Something happens:
- My kids got to go to school
- One of my friends gets sick (in terms of downsizing)
- People look at each other and say "it's time to move"

All of a sudden they start to actively invest time and energy to figure out what to do.

#### 4. Active Looking
They're actively investing time and energy.

#### 5. Event 2
Usually time-bound, puts some criteria around what's going to happen that says "we need a car now, we need a house now."

#### 6. Deciding Phase
**Important web insight**: People think if you come to the site that everybody's buying. A lot of times people are just looking, they're shopping, they're trying to shape up what they're trying to do as opposed to actually deciding.

#### 7. Buy

#### 8. Consume

### Critical Point
The most important aspect of this is we don't ask people from coming back here to say "oh I love this product and tell me about it." We actually have them tell the story as if they were going through it again.

**Why?** Half the features they love, they actually didn't think about when they bought it. We need to understand the essence of the product, the essence of the experience that they were thinking about and deciding on at the moment they decided.

### The Dominoes
Ryan Singer (who we work with at 37signals) basically came up with this notion that there's these dominoes that you got to understand. "Okay, this product ended up on the table, this is what you've got - how did it get here? Tell me the story of how this got here."

As you back it out, you start to realize there's a series of causalities. And guess what? There's a pattern to the causality. You do one interview, you do two interviews, you do ten interviews - you actually start to see the patterns. The patterns help you see where the opportunities are and they help you see the real competitive set.

## Framework 3: The Kano Model of Quality

This is from Dr. Kano from Japan. I met him in the 80s when I worked in Japan. He highlighted something really important: **Not all attributes are the same. Not all features and attributes are the same.**

### The Axes
- **Vertical axis**: From "very dissatisfied" (bottom) to "very satisfied/ecstatic" (top)
- **Horizontal axis**: From "didn't do it at all" (left) to "really achieved it" (right)

### Three Types of Attributes

#### 1. Expected/Basic Quality
**Example: Car brakes**
- "I love my brakes"
- But if I put $10 more in brakes to let you stop a foot shorter, how satisfied are you? Not really.
- But if the brakes don't work, how satisfied are you? Very dissatisfied.

These are expected or basic quality requirements.

#### 2. Performance Quality
**Example: Gas mileage**
- When I do it, people are really excited
- When I don't do it, people are really dissatisfied

Linear relationship between achievement and satisfaction.

#### 3. Excitement Attributes
- When I don't do it, it really isn't that big a deal
- But when I do do it: "Wow, I'm really excited!"

**Examples:**
- Remote starter
- Integration with Pandora
- "I didn't expect it, I didn't want it, but when you did it I love it"

### The Critical Insight
**What is excitement today becomes performance tomorrow, and what is performance today becomes basic/expected tomorrow.**

This is why we need to always be talking to our customers - we need to know when things shift. What becomes basic is really important. We don't need to over-invest in basic quality or expected quality. We need to invest in performance and excitement quality.

## Live Interview: Tyler's Car Purchase

### Setup
Tyler agreed to participate in a live interview about his recent car purchase. The interview demonstrates the Jobs to be Done methodology in action.

**Chris's Introduction**: "We're doing some real early stage research on how people shop for and buy cars. We're going to do some real formal crazy huge research months down the road, but all we're trying to do at this point is get language around how people describe their car shopping and buying experience. We're looking for just your story, how you came to buy the car that you bought. No right or wrong answers because it's just your story."

**Interview Style**: "There are going to be times where we're kind of vague and we're kind of up in the atmosphere and then we're going to go really really deep. The way to think about it is it's as if I was filming a documentary about how people shop for cars over the last 25 years and I'm standing over your shoulder. You're in the dealership - I want to know everything that I need to describe that scene: who was with you, what time of day was it, what was the sales person like. Kind of set the scene for me so I can recreate it and I can kind of relive it."

### Basic Facts
- **Car purchased**: 2012 Volkswagen Jetta Comfort Line, silver
- **Purchase date**: February 28th (end of February)
- **Dealer**: "Some super shady looking used car dealer in an industrial lot outside of Toronto"
- **Does not name his cars**: "I'm not a car guy at all"

### The Journey

#### Background Context
Tyler was using car rentals and car sharing (Zipcar). He really didn't want to buy a car - he used to own one. His wife wasn't against owning one, but he was always pushing against it.

They had a baby (Edison, born June 26th, 2012). Tyler's wife was on maternity leave for a year.

**Tyler's mindset**: "I was like, well someday in the future we're probably going to need a car, but let's... I had friends who had kids and they didn't have cars, like let's hold out as long as we can."

#### The Trigger Event
**Tyler**: "I think what made me finally go 'okay we'll start looking at cars' was because we were using Zipcar or renting a car. Sometimes it'd just be easier to use my wife's family - they live like an hour outside of Toronto - and we take these commuter trains."

**The critical moment**: "She missed the commuter train once and they only came once an hour, and she was on a commuter train platform with a six-month-old in the winter in Toronto for an hour. I was like 'I would murder someone if I was in her scenario.' So I was like 'okay let's start looking for a car.'"

**Important note**: It wasn't that it happened to her - it was the fact that Tyler didn't want it to happen.

**Tyler on his wife's reaction**: "She was like 'oh you know, Edison was in good behavior' and blah blah." She wasn't pushing for the car - Tyler was angrier about the scenario.

**Timing**: The stranding happened in early January, maybe late December. The car was purchased in late February - so it took 6-8 weeks.

#### Alternative Solutions
Even after the trigger event, Tyler was still exploring alternatives:
- His wife went to her parents every week or two
- Found a really good Enterprise dealership near their place that would pick up and drop off a car
- Zipcar daily rates
- Getting a lift to Hamilton with her sister

"There's like a mishmash of solutions."

**The train**: After the stranding incident, Tyler's wife might have taken it maybe one more time, but it was basically out. "The logistics of it - you gotta have the baby's car seat on the stroller and then whoever's picking you up at the train station, like my father-in-law, you got to put the car seat in his car. I was just like 'okay well I know I gotta inconvenience other people.'"

It was a whole bunch of things, but that one extra thing just tipped it.

#### Initial Research
**First search**: Tyler went online. Because of Zipcar and renting cars, he'd driven "every brand and model of sedan" that he was probably going to consider.

**Tyler**: "I knew I'm just a frugal person by nature, so I'm gonna buy something relatively cheap, so I had an idea of what I wanted."

**First website**: "I must have gone online been like 'what...' because I probably didn't even have a concept of what a new car cost at that point. I used to own a Volkswagen - that was the car I owned when I used to live in Seattle but I never drove it. So when I moved back to Toronto I got rid of it. I'm sure the first thing I probably did was went to Volkswagen's website to see what a new Golf or Jetta..."

**But**: Tyler was still looking at Enterprise and other solutions - the car thing was still off the table at some point because he was looking for other solutions.

**Tyler**: "I either walk or bike to work. We never drive a car. We rarely ever drive a car. We only use it for going to family or driving to IKEA."

#### The IKEA Problem
**Interviewer**: "Wait, what's driving to IKEA like?"

**Tyler**: "Not that bad, just because of where we are in the city."

**Interviewer**: "You don't only need a car every once in a while - I don't understand how you got a car."

**Tyler**: "Well, if you want to go to IKEA in a Zipcar, it's like 'okay I gotta try and guess how long everything's gonna take me.' So it's like 'okay this probably should only be like a 90-minute trip but I got to rent the car for four hours because maybe my son's gonna take a longer nap and I gotta get...' and it's harder to book them on the weekend and I don't wanna have to walk too far and I gotta put the car seat in the stroller and there's all this extra time that I spend getting to the car, building up, and then whatever might extend the trip."

"And then when you're like 'oh god I just spent an hour in IKEA and I'm really ready to kill someone,' then instead of just going home be like 'oh at least I'm done for the day,' I gotta drive back to the Zipcar parking lot and then get my son out of the car seat and put him in a stroller and then walk like 20 minutes back to my house. And in all the steps he probably wants to just go for a nap or something. So it's like 'okay I just wasted several hours of my time with this loop.'"

**Conclusion**: "So in the end this is about just convenience - just making it that much easier."

#### VW Website Navigation
Tyler went to VW.ca. He probably typed in "VW dealership search VW."

**Rental experience**: He hadn't rented any VWs - "you usually get American cars" - Ford, Kia, Hyundai, Honda, Toyota, Chevy - "the whole gamut." He rarely ever got a Volkswagen.

**Why VW first?**: "Because I really liked my old Volkswagen."

**About the old car**: It was his dad's old Volkswagen Golf - a 2000 model with a sunroof. He got it from his dad in his last year of university, was living in Toronto for a bit, then took it out to Seattle. "I rarely ever drove it, but I think probably because I had it when I was in university in Toronto, I really liked it."

**VW advantage**: "Volkswagens are pretty good for tall people - the amount of legroom stuff is good on it."

**Interviewer**: "How did you know that?"

**Tyler**: "Well I didn't know that was true about the Jetta until I drove one."

#### Pricing Out Cars
On the VW site, Tyler priced out what he needed: "I was like 'okay well I gotta have the most bare requirements I need' and it's like 'well I need air conditioning' and I think that was about it."

**Christmas rental experience**: At Christmas, Tyler had rented a car for like a week to go to his in-laws and parents - a Kia Forte. "The trunk is like, you know, it's a decent size but it's bigger than a Golf and the thing was filled - like every square inch was packed with stroller, portable crib, Christmas gifts, our stuff. I was just like 'oh my god I filled this thing.' I was like 'if we ever buy a car, a hatchback is just not gonna do it.'"

This ruled out the Golf.

#### Other Brands Considered
Tyler looked at:
- **Kia**: Priced it out, all new
- **Subaru**: "They had dirt cheap financing - like zero percent financing for five years. I was like 'well maybe I can justify something like a new car that I don't have to worry at all about it. If anything goes wrong with this car I'm gonna be like "hey this is your car."'"

The concern about things going wrong was there the whole time.

**Subaru appeal**: "The car had utility to it that I liked and the design of it met my base requirements for design."

#### Design Rejections
Tyler had strong design opinions that led to outright rejections:

**Tyler**: "I already didn't want to buy a car, so if I was gonna curse the thing every day I knew I wasn't gonna..."

**Hyundai**: "There were certain things about the center console I just couldn't stand. The buttons feel really cheap on all the things."

**Honda**: "The gauges aren't mechanical, they're just digital displays. It's like I feel like I'm driving a Ford from the 80s or something. It's just not a nice tactile experience."

**Toyota**: "They have the dash central - there's no way I was doing that. It doesn't make sense to me."

**Tyler**: "I knew that every time I drive the car I'd be like 'stupid piece of crap.'"

#### The Spreadsheet
**Tyler**: "I'm a horrible data nerd. I had a spreadsheet of different cars I was considering - both new and used - and what the operating costs of those cars would be for the next five years, like what the amortized cost would be."

He knew the trade-offs. He had fuel economy based on what he thought he was going to drive in the next year, which "actually turned out to be correct in terms of mileage and stuff per month."

He got insurance quotes on a couple cars.

**Purpose**: "That was all basically for my own mental buy-in of what I was getting."

**Key discovery**: "When I started looking at used cars, there was one or two-year-old Jettas that were selling at... I was just like 'that is a huge drop off from new cars.' I was like 'I think I can get this done.'"

#### Dealership Visit Day
**Date**: A Monday, maybe February 23rd

**Why Monday?**: "I just didn't have time on the weekend."

**The schedule**: Tyler had to go to Pearson Airport that morning for a security interview for a trusted traveler program for Edison with the US government. "I was like 'well if I'm there I'll go to that VW dealership' and then I think I also booked a meeting at another VW dealership because I was like 'well I'm gonna go to this one then we'll just go to the other one to see pricing.'"

**Who came**: Tyler's wife (his "stunningly beautiful wife") and Edison

**Transportation**: Zipcar - a Honda. "I didn't loathe it but I was just like 'I'm not giving these people my money.'"

#### First Dealership (Near Pearson Airport)
**Condition**: "Currently under renovation so you walked into their garage - it was not a very nice looking space."

**Preparation**: Tyler had called ahead the previous day (Sunday) saying "when I get there I want there to be someone who I can talk to, I don't want to wait when I get there." They said "okay Joe or whatever the guy's name was will..."

**What he asked for**: "I'm thinking about buying a used 2012 Jetta" because they had a whole bunch listed on Craigslist.

**The test drive**: They pulled out a used 2012 Trendline Jetta (the lowest, cheapest Jetta).

**Model hierarchy**: Trendline → Trendline Plus → Comfort Line → Comfort Line Plus, etc.

**The drive**: Tyler's wife went and sat in the dealership with Edison. Tyler did the test drive alone and came back: "Yeah it's good, it meets my standard of driving."

**Wife's involvement**: "She didn't really care. She was like 'if you're fine with it I'm fine with it.'"

#### Negotiation Failure #1
**Interviewer**: "Why didn't you just sign right there?"

**Tyler**: "Couldn't come to price."

**Interviewer**: "You knew the prices already though?"

**Tyler**: "Yeah so I figured there was some room for haggling and there was none."

Tyler had other prices he'd seen. The salesperson: "Then you get into that ridiculous interaction with sales guys at dealerships who are like 'well this is the best I can do, let me go talk to my manager.'"

**Tyler**: "I was like 'why do you have to? You don't have the authority to make do anything here. Why don't I just talk to your manager?'"

**The realization**: "Then I found out that this is how it always works."

**In the moment**: Tyler didn't know this was standard - he was just like "I can't talk to him but he's the decision maker? Why?"

**The outcome**: The guy said "we cannot go lower than [some price]." Tyler: "Okay well then I'm clearly misinformed about the pricing of this car because other used car listings are lower than that. I have an appointment with another VW dealership down the highway, I'll give you a call back."

The guy didn't budge at all. He called at the end of the day but it didn't work out.

#### Second Dealership
Tyler left with his wife and Edison and went to the other dealer.

**Hope**: "That I could haggle a better price out of that."

**Mental state**: "If I can buy a certified used Volkswagen from the dealership then I'll have less concern in my mind about the maintenance of it, that it's always been maintained by VW, blah blah."

**Trade-off forming**: Tyler had a max price in mind with his wife. "If I can get the guy down to this price - done. I would drive out, save as much time as possible and be just done with the whole thing."

#### Negotiation Failure #2
**Time**: Around noon

They drove to the next dealership, "went through this rigmarole again."

**The pitch**: The guy tried to sell Tyler every other brand of Volkswagen. "He was like 'well we can sell you a Golf cheaper.'"

**Tyler**: "My stroller doesn't fit in the back of a Volkswagen Golf."

**Salesperson**: "Are you sure?"

**Tyler**: "Are we actually going to do this?"

**What happened**: Tyler rolled the stroller into the dealership, they popped open the trunk of the Golf - doesn't fit. "Guy's like 'back to the conversation I want to have.'"

**Wife's state**: "Sitting there kind of being like... My wife's a very charming and polite person but once you're on her... then you're done. You can just see you're like biting your lip with this guy being like 'why is... if you can't do the price then just say it. You're wasting our time' kind of thing."

**Duration**: About an hour

**The negotiation**: Went back and forth on price. Same thing - "let me talk to my manager about the price." Manager's like "there's no way we can go that low because this is the price we even bought the car at."

**Tyler's reaction**: "Which made me be like 'hold on... if he's telling me that number... I have... he has information that I don't have. Something... he's making money elsewhere that I don't understand. I'm just gonna get ripped off. I'm leaving.'"

#### Third Dealership
**Mental state**: "I just did not trust the scenario at that point. It's not even one dealership or the other dealership - it's the whole dealership thing is kind of weird."

"Which is unfortunate because I then drove to another dealership - a third one."

**Location**: Really close by, another VW dealer

**Tyler's thinking**: "Let's just see what happens. I already sunk all this time dealing... I'm not taking another day off to deal with these idiots, so let's see what happens."

**Result**: "Exact same thing happened."

#### After Three Dealerships
**Tyler's feeling**: "Oh my god I got it - I'm never buying a car again."

**Wife's input**: "Maybe we don't have to buy a car... Maybe our expectations on price isn't right or something. Maybe we really can't get it for this price based on the other thing."

**What they did**: "We went and ate because you asked me a second ago. Okay well let's go home, I'll go to the office and then we'll figure this out again."

#### The Russian Mobster Solution
**Timing**: Tyler thinks that night or someday that week. They bought the car on a Saturday, so he must have gone to the used car lot with his wife on a Thursday night or Friday.

**How he found it**: "Just something like Craigslist."

**The listing**: "His price was almost where I wanted it to be and it was just a kind of freak listing of low kilometers."

**Tyler's approach**: "I was like 'okay... as bad as the dealers were, I'm now mentally prepared - used car dealer's gonna be insanely bad.'"

**The call**: "This guy was just like 'uh yeah when did you want to come in?' I was like 'I'll be there whatever it was - Thursday at six o'clock or something like that.'"

**The visit**: The three of them piled into a Zipcar and went to the used car lot - "an industrial space in Oakville, suburb of Toronto."

**The scene**: "Car was meticulous. The office was just so shady and dirty and I was just like 'oh my god this is ridiculous.'"

**The car**: "Perfectly fine. He had just bought it at an auction the week before."

**The negotiation**: "There was literally nothing wrong with the car. I was just like 'this thing is brand new.' So I was like 'I just want to take it to the Volkswagen dealership' - the third dealership I went to was actually on the other side of the highway - 'can I take it to them to inspect it?'"

"I can't remember what his asking price was. I was like 'can you do it at this price?' and he hit a calculator, he's like 'done.'"

**The inspection**: "The next day my wife brought the car to the VW dealership. Mechanic told her 'this is a brand new car, there's nothing wrong with this car.'"

**The purchase**: "So we went on Saturday, gave him the money."

**The specs**:
- 28,000 kilometers (about 17,400 miles)
- Still had standard warranty coverage (100,000 km)
- Not certified pre-owned, but still under manufacturer warranty
- "The lowest price Jetta I could possibly buy in southeastern Ontario I'm guessing"

## Analysis of Tyler's Interview

### The Four Forces

**Bob**: "What was the push?"

The train, having the kid, the inconvenience of rental cars, having to try to find the right one, all the inconvenience.

**Bob**: "What was the pull?"

VW, some historical emotional connection - the college VW. But also certain things were out for sure (design rejections).

**Bob**: "What was the anxiety?"

The car's gonna break, the price, getting a deal. At the end of the day all he really wanted was a little bit off and the ability to negotiate. If he didn't have that ability to negotiate, it was done.

**Bob**: "The habit of the present was fantastic because you could feel this - I haven't owned a car in so long."

Tyler talked about his friends: "We have friends that have kids that have done this, so now there's like 'we can do this, we can pull this off, we can overcome the evil car dealership people that want us to drive cars because we know people that have done that.'"

There's a habit - we can innovate and we can get around it. For a year, eight months after the baby's born, it's like "no we're not doing it - we can Zipcar it, we can take the GO train, we're not gonna tip."

But you have to start to feel how everything else starts to pile up. The fact that she got stranded on the deck of the train - everything piles up in order to get him to eventually switch.

### Key Insights

**Discrete stories**: Piling all the stuff in the trunk - you could picture him standing there saying "this is a design consideration that I need to be aware of." A day ago it wasn't like that, but now it's like "the Kia trunk is full, if the Golf can't make it, it's out."

All that story helps you lead to... "How unique do you think his story is actually?"

**Chris**: "It's not. When you start to do three, four... to be honest we've been doing them, you start to realize there's an issue here."

There are patterns. You start to realize there's an issue of the switching aspects.

### Business Opportunities

**For Zipcar**: Does Zipcar have an opportunity to just rent long-term or buy from them? Can they take their customer base and somehow monetize it in a different way, knowing that people are struggling like this and wanting to get out? Can they leverage that habit? Because the progress of buying the car - you wanted to go the other way. So you actually create anxiety about the new car buying experience to keep them with Zip.

**For car dealers**: Do you actually advertise the new car buying experience to create anxiety to keep them with Zip?

## Q&A Insights

### Question: Minimum Viable Product vs. Complete Product

**Audience member**: "I'm always battling people in my company - minimum viable product versus something I think is actually exciting and sellable. I'm always going for more, they're always going for less. The various diagrams you showed look to me like if I give somebody the complete minimum and I'm giving them things that they might expect, they're not actually going to be delighted or see a very different way of doing things. So I'm just trying to find confirmation for my bias so I can go back and tell people I'm right."

**Bob**: "That's right. If you just give them the basics it's not necessary - you need to actually hit the performance. But the key is what are the performance and the excitement variables and what are the criteria?"

"You need to listen to stories of what people have done in the past because for every one of Tyler's there's probably another 300 or 300,000 people out there trying to buy who are going through the same kind of experience. So how do you make it better for him or them to buy cars?"

### The Big Hire vs. The Little Hire

**Chris**: "The other thing that we always talk about is what we call the big hire - so it's the switch, it's buying the product. But the other thing that we always need to consider is the little hire."

"Using it - every time you get in the car and you drive it, is it delighting you or is it annoying you and pushing you towards another car?"

"So there might be something in addition to basic quality that you need to add to keep them delighted over time. And this works in software, this works in services, this works in everything."

## Key Takeaways

1. **The struggling moment is the seed of innovation** - find where people are struggling to make progress

2. **Context has more value than content** - understand the situation, not just demographics

3. **Focus on switching behavior** - talk to people who have recently bought or switched, not people who might buy

4. **The Four Forces determine switching**:
   - Push of current situation
   - Pull of new solution
   - Anxiety of new solution
   - Habit of the present

5. **Look backwards, not forwards** - people can't predict what they'll do, but they can describe what they did

6. **Find the causality** - understand the dominoes that led to the purchase decision

7. **Not all features are equal** - excitement becomes performance becomes basic over time (Kano Model)

8. **Reducing anxiety is as important as adding features** - sometimes the best product improvement is removing complexity

9. **Competition is defined by the consumer** - cars compete with bikes and trains, not just other cars

10. **The timeline reveals patterns** - first thought → passive looking → event → active looking → deciding → buying → consuming
